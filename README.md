# Twitter-COVID-19-Analysis

This is a final project for a data course.

The analysis is performed on 15,018,765 tweets related to COVID-19 from 29-days interval from 2021/10/15 to 2021/11/12. 
Majority of tweets are from the United States and United Kingdom. 
Higher tweets volume between 10/18/2021 and 10/21/2021 is likely due to government and health official announcements.

## User groups and retweets:
The project has categorized users into 5 groups: news organizations, government-affiliated accounts, health organizations, influencers and others (random users). 
Majority of the tweets (95% of total tweets) are from others (random users). Influencers have the second highest tweet volume, which accounts for 3% of the total tweets. 
Only 5% of total tweets can be considered as a credible source of information regarding COVID-19. Those tweets are from news organizations, government-affiliated accounts, health organizations and certain influencers. Those tweets are more likely to be the original tweets rather than retweets.
71.12% of total tweets are retweets. News outlets have the least amount of retweets, while influencers have the most.
## Near-duplicate and unique tweets:
Majority of the near-Duplicated tweets are from random users, followed by influencers and news outlets. 
On average, 1 in 4 original tweets from a government affiliated account is a near-duplicate.
1 in 5 original tweets from a news outlet or a health organization is a near-duplicate.
